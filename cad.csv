Case ID,Prompt Scenario,Description,Purpose of Validation,Failure Mode,Effect,Cause
1,Tag Name Mismatch,Design tag name differs from implemented tag,Ensure semantic alignment of signal references,Incorrect signal mapping,Wrong control execution,Tag aliasing or config error
2,Trigger Logic Drift,Triggering logic in design differs from implementation,Ensure correct safety/control logic,Incorrect shutdown or activation,Failure to initiate or halt process,Logic change without review
3,Unexpected Signal Behavior,Runtime tag value contradicts expected behavior,Catch invalid signal state,Invalid state transition,Unintended operation or alarm,Sensor glitch or logic fault
4,Incomplete Tag Mapping,Tag defined in design is unmapped in runtime,Identify gaps in configuration,Missing logic or control,Inoperative safety/control path,Tag not deployed
5,Redundant/Obsolete Logic,Deprecated logic still active in implementation,Remove legacy and unsafe code,Unexpected control behavior,Execution of invalid path,Old logic not cleaned
6,Timing/Delay Inconsistencies,Execution delays differ from design expectation,Validate sequence response times,Missed timing window,Process or safety failure,Wrong delay settings
7,Conflicting Interlocks,Two logic paths conflict or overlap,Ensure interlock consistency,Override conflict or lockout,Unreliable system behavior,Poor interlock design
8,Design vs. Runtime Condition,Runtime behavior diverges from design logic,Validate logic under test inputs,Logic drift or broken path,Inaccurate process control,Outdated or incorrect logic
9,Mode Transition Failures,Manual/Auto mode shift behaves incorrectly,Ensure proper transition logic,Unexpected system behavior,Operator confusion or unsafe state,Missing or faulty mode logic
10,Bypassed Safety Layers,Implementation allows bypassing critical safety,Detect unsafe override conditions,Disabled fail-safes,Hazard to equipment or personnel,Unauthorized override logic
11,Incorrect Logic Grouping,Logic placed under wrong functional hierarchy,Enforce architecture integrity,Wrong area response or scope,Scope violation,Design misalignment
12,Unmodeled Scenarios,Implementation has logic absent from design,Capture undocumented paths,Undocumented behavior,Unvalidated failure response,Hidden code or quick fix
13,Control Flow Anomalies,Dead paths or infinite loops in logic,Ensure clean control logic,Wasted compute or wrong outcome,Inconsistent logic navigation,Unclean implementation
14,Missing Safety Validation Paths,No fail-safe paths implemented where expected,Enforce validation routines,Failure to detect issues,Increased hazard exposure,Validation logic omitted
